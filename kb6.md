1234
AI for Good is a year-round digital
platform where AI innovators and problem owners learn, 
build and connect to identify practical AI solutions to 
advance the UN SDGs. We have less than 10 years to solve the 
United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AI enhances decision-making by analyzing vast amounts of data quickly and 
accurately, identifying patterns and insights that might be missed by humans. 
This enables businesses to make more informed, data-driven decisions, improving 
efficiency, reducing errors, and ultimately leading to better outcomes.

James co-founded and serves as the CEO of the AI for Good Foundation. Previously,
James directed AI research at Bloomberg in New York, leading a team 
of 20 in a rich cross-disciplinary research agenda.
